Use the OH emission lines for wavelength calibration. 
Ask about lamps. TSPEC is consistent.

delta = delta(ra)*cos(dec), .33 #dec was never converted so it's in time seconds!

Don't conflate arcseconds and time seconds!
check screen capture. 
Moderate to heavy cloud cover for ABBA and Full Moon has risen (9:24 PM Pacific Time) 
	5 minute each of the 4 exposures in ABBA. 
Will need secondary background calibration mentioned in class. 

Type the snap command into the TSPEC;cl window
First image is image0065.fits
image0065

Onedif and TWodif both appear noisy. 

9:50 PM ABBA 5 minute exposures each. image0069 through image0072
Persistence can interfere with later obsevations


There is signal, it's just all telluric. I really just measured OH lines. 

image0094 - image0093 = TritonDiff1
image0096 - image0095 = TritonDiff2
same for TritonDiff3 and TritonDiff4. All 60s exposures. TritonDiff5 and TritonDiff6
were 5 minutes.
image0101 through image0104 were all 5 minute exposures.
Some of the Triton images incorrectly have the wrong name (they say Arnav). 
image0108 - image0107 = Hip115119.fits 30 second each ABBA dither.
